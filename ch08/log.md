Get max speed:
1. 128 batch -  84 f/s
2. 32 batch  - 141 f/s

Filter empty bars. Run "Nov13_07-21-51_gpu-simple-filter"
Still no convergence.

Next things to check:
* Disable noisy nets, replacing by long epsilon decay (1M frames or something)
* Give a reward after order close equal to full profit 

Both started.

Not clear why value of held-out states are dropping sharply after step 100k.
Maybe that's due to sampling of states which is performed not uniformly but with prio replay buffer...
Check this with simple replay buffer replacement...

Idea: implement simple growing trend (maybe with some noice) and test the agent on it.
