Point-1 experiments: return back to the convergence state.

Data filtering was returned by default. Run started.

Convergence is great: reached positive reward in an hour.

Percentage reward scheme was implemented and run as Nov16_13-30-57_gpu-conv-p1-perc-reward

This scan is also converging, trying to run the same on all 2016 data.
Fixed the bug with extensive filtering on small quotes. 2016 data started Nov16_15-09-10_gpu-conv-p1-perc-reward-2016

Implemented next adjustment: bar open price tweak. If open price for current bar doesn't match close bar of the previous,
open price set to close bar. This should make more correct rewards.

Started model with 20 bars context and 1m replay buffer on 2016 prices.
Started as Nov16_22-17-33_home-conv-p1-bars=20-replay=1m-2016

Need to implement good testing utility + validation test during training.

Results on current run is not very impressive: 2016 runs don't converge, run with fixed open price
converges much worse than before.

Need to implement:
1. proper reward calculation which takes in account not only bar's movement, but also gaps. Disable open price fix and test.
1. Volumes in the data
2. Testing of system on arbitrary data. Things need to be calculated:
    1. count of orders done
    2. ratio of profitable and loosing orders
    3. mean profitable and loosing order
    4. final balance
    5. max drawdown
    6. balance chart
    7. profit chart
