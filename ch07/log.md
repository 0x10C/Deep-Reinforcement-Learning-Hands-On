Breakout-v4 not converging. Maybe, it's replay buffer size.

Ways to overcome:
1. Try params from DQN paper: 1M buffer, 10k sync. Started on gpu#1, log-basic-full-1.txt, 
stopped, as 1M buffer will require 100GB of RAM
2. Change back to pong, the only difference is final epsilon - 10%

Started three versions:
1. basic
2. 2-steps
3. double dqn

Upd: convergence is weird, reverted epsilon back to 2% and restarted.

Next to implement: noisy nets, using noisy layer using https://github.com/Kaixhin/NoisyNet-A3C/blob/master/model.py
 
Noisy layer in Kaixhin looks suspicious, need to check with noise turned off.
