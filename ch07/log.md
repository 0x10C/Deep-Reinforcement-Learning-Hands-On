Breakout-v4 not converging. Maybe, it's replay buffer size.

Ways to overcome:
1. Try params from DQN paper: 1M buffer, 10k sync. Started on gpu#1, log-basic-full-1.txt, 
stopped, as 1M buffer will require 100GB of RAM
2. Change back to pong, the only difference is final epsilon - 10%

Started three versions:
1. basic
2. 2-steps
3. double dqn

Upd: convergence is weird, reverted epsilon back to 2% and restarted.

Next to implement: noisy nets, using noisy layer using https://github.com/Kaixhin/NoisyNet-A3C/blob/master/model.py
 
--Noisy layer in Kaixhin looks suspicious, need to check with noise turned off.--
Found the reason, original code assumed sample_noise call every iteration.
Rerun started, need to wait.

Todo:
1. run new version of noisy net, check convergence. Started as log-noisy-3.txt
2. implement factorized gaussian noise from the paper

# 2017-10-28

Noisy net converged. Still need to check factorized version, but so far I have done:
1. basic test
2. 2-step
3. double net
4. noisy net

Still need to be implemented and verified:
* Dueling version
* Prio replay buffer
* Distributional

Factorized noise v1 converges badly. Will try:
1. separate random var for bias (v2) -- not helped much
2. fix initialization and f(x) (v3) -- not converging
2. remove requires_grad=False from vars (v4)
3. roll back to full noise

Need to bring initialization to independent noise and test it.
Independent noise works perfectly.

As an idea: check mean and l2 for mean and std for sigma.

# 2017-10-29

Graphs of sigma have shown that values become NaNs, I guess it's due to zero division. To avoid this, clamp applied to abs.
Clamp are not working, leave factorized gradients for now.

Dueling modification implemented and converges good.

Want to have an extra environment of greater complexity (SpaceInvaders)
